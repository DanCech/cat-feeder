# Yet Another Internet-enabled Cat Feeder

This project is designed to replace the electronics in a commercal automated cat feeder that stopped working.

The feeder itself is very simple, consisting of a 5v motor to dispense food and a microswith to detect each portion of food that is dispensed.
